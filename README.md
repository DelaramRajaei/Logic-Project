# Health Monitoring System

## Description:
This project is the final project for the Logical Circuits course, where a health monitoring system is designed to receive various personal and vital characteristics from the user. By analyzing and examining these characteristics, the system provides different alerts to the user. The purpose of this project is to familiarize students with the design of embedded systems. Students are required to design the core processing unit of a hidden embedded system.

## Functionality:
The system, using input information, measures health criteria including blood pressure, body temperature, and occurrences of nervous or cardiac shock, displaying relevant information for each section as output. Additionally, in case of critical conditions (such as high blood pressure, fever, nervous or cardiac shock), the system immediately alerts the individual. Personal information of the user such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood concentration, and blood type can be adjusted, impacting the calculation of vital signs.

## Installation and Usage:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and run the project code.
4. Simulate the health monitoring system using appropriate simulation tools.
5. Test the functionality of the system by providing input data and observing the output.

## Notes:
- Ensure that all components and modules are properly integrated and functioning within the simulation.
- Refer to the project documentation and comments in the code for detailed explanations of the system's design and operation.
- Customize the system as needed to meet specific requirements or to extend its functionality.
